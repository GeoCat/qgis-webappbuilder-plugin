<p>The dropdown list shows the editable layers in the web app. AT the beginning, it will be empty, since app layers are not editable. You have to add your own editable layers, by clicking on the plus icon on the right side of the dropdown list. You will see the following dialog</p>

<p>Enter a name for the layer and select the geometry type in the corresponding field. You can also select the color to use when rendering features from this layer.</p>

<p>If you want to add attributes to the layer, enter their names in the <i>Attributes</i> field, separated by commas. If you leave that field empty, the layer will only have geometries, and you wont be prompted to enter attribute values when a new feature is added.

<p>Close the dialog clicking on <i>OK</i> and you will see your new layer in the list of available editable layers. </p>

Clicking on the <i>Enable edit mode</i> button will set the edit tool. You can now enter new features by clicking on the map canvas to add points, lines or polygons, depending on the geometry type of the layer. In the case of lines and polygons, doubl-click to enter the last point of the geometry.</p>

<p>If the layer has attributes defined in its schema, you will be prompted to enter their values</p>
