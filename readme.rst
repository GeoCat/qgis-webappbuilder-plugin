Web app builder
=====================

A QGIS plugin to easily create web apps based on the OpenGeo Suite.

To install the latest development version, download `this file <https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-app-builder/archive/master.zip>`_ unzip it, and copy the *webappbuilder* folder under your QGIS plugins folder (~/.qgis2/python/plugins/, you may need to create this folder). You should have a ~/.qgis2/python/plugins/webappbuilder. Start QGIS and the plugin should already be available.

Usage is documented `here <https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-app-builder/blob/docs/manual/usage.rst>`_

`Sample data and examples apps <https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-app-builder/blob/docs/examples/exampleapps.rst>`_  based on it are available. You can download the files with the app definitions used to build up those examples, and the corresponding layers data. Use them to explore the capabilities of the plugin and create your own apps.
