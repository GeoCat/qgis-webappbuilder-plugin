Web app builder
=====================

A QGIS plugin to easily create web apps based on the OpenGeo Suite.

To install the latest development version, download `this file <https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-app-builder/archive/master.zip>`_ unzip it, and copy the *webappbuilder* folder under your QGIS plugins folder (~/.qgis2/python/plugins/, you may need to create this folder). You should have a ~/.qgis2/python/plugins/webappbuilder. Start QGIS and the plugin should already be available.

Documentation is found `here <http://suite.opengeo.org/docs/latest/qgis/webappbuilder/>`_
